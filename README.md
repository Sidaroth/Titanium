# Titanium
Codename Titanium - Serious Game supplementing higher level mathematical education.

## Work in Progress - Research Projects
This project is intended to be used as the development part of two research & development projects at NTNU in Gj√∏vik, Norway.
Specifically for advanced project work, and my Master's Thesis. 

Updates will come periodically. 

## External Assets used
- Unreal Starter Content
- https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Resources/Showcases/RealisticRendering/

- https://www.cgtrader.com/3d-models/electronics/phones-small-appliance/digital-room-thermometer

As these assets are *not* pushed to the repository, to run this you will have to manually add them to the project (they are quite large).
